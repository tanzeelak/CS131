Below is an ambiguous puzzle I found for N = 4: 
C = counts([3,2,2,1],[2,1,2,3],[3,2,1,2],[1,2,2,3])
T1 = [[1,3,2,4],[3,1,4,2],[4,2,1,3],[2,4,3,1]]
T2 = [[2,3,1,4],[3,2,4,1],[4,1,2,3],[1,4,3,2]]

My speed_up clause runs both tower(4,T, counts([3,3,2,1],[2,1,3,3],[4,2,1,2],[1,2,4,2])) and plain_tower(4,T, counts([3,3,2,1],[2,1,3,3],[4,2,1,2],[1,2,4,2])), which both generate the same valid T matrix. The performance is about the same, evaluating to a ratio of plain_tower/tower at 1.0.
